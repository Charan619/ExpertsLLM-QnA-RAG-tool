# Q&A Tool Enhancement Possibilities :

## I. Improving Accuracy

1.  **Refined Data Processing:**

    *   **Richer Metadata:** Extract key entities, sentiment, and explicit client questions using NLP lbraries to improve retrieval and prompting.
    *   **Structured Data Handling:** Implement specialized parsers for any tables or figures to make them LLM-usable.

2.  **Sophisticated Retrieval Techniques:**
    *   **Hybrid & Re-ranked Search:** Combine keyword (BM25) and semantic search, then use cross-encoders to re-rank top results for higher relevance.
    *   **Intelligent Querying:** Employ LLMs for query expansion/transformation to broaden the search net effectively.
    *   **Contextual Retrieval:** Use parent document retrievers or hierarchical indexing to provide broader context around focused retrieved chunks.

3.  **Optimized Models & Prompts:**
    *   **Specialized Embeddings:** Fine-tune embedding models on domain-specific call transcripts or experiment with newer, more powerful embedding models.
    *   **Dynamic Prompting:** Adapt prompt instructions based on query type or the quality/density of retrieved context.

## II. Reducing Hallucination

1.  **Strict LLM Grounding & Guidance:**
    *   **Context-Bound Instructions:** Strongly reinforce in prompts that the LLM must *only* use provided context and explicitly state when information is not found.
    *   **Relevance Filtering:** Ensure only highly relevant, quality-checked chunks (e.g., via re-ranking and relevance score thresholds) are passed to the LLM.
    *   **Conciseness & Scope Control:** Instruct the LLM to provide concise answers, reducing the opportunity for off-topic generation.

2.  **Verification & Transparency Mechanisms:**
    *   **Advanced Fact-Checking:** Implement LLM-based self-critique where the model verifies its generated statements against source documents or implement quote verification.
    *   **Source Transparency (Existing & Enhanced):** Continue clearly displaying source documents; enhance by highlighting exact text segments supporting the answer to empower user verification.
    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Explore prompting the LLM for confidence scores to flag potentially less reliable answers for user review.

3.  **Strategic Model Selection:**
    *   **Prioritize Instruct-Tuned LLMs:** Continue using models fine-tuned for instruction-following and factuality, as these generally exhibit better grounding.
    *   **Evaluate Model Capabilities:** While larger models might sometimes offer benefits, balance this against resource costs and verify their specific strengths in factual recall from context.
